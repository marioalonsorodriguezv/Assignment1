```

## Data

This is an assignment that utilizes fivethirtyeight.com's dataset on alcohol consumption in the world. This data is taken from the World Health Organization.  

```{r Drinks}
### First we load the data from fivethirtyeight's Github
Drinks <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/alcohol-consumption/drinks.csv')

### We can take a look at the data
View(Drinks)

### We get a simple summary of descriptive statistics with this function
summary(beer_servings)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
