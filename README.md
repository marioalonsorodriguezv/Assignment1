This is the first Assignment of Collaborative Social Science Data Analysis Class of the Hertie School of Governance. 

Authors: Mario Rodriguez and Raju Adhikari
Name of Repository on Github: Assignment1
Datasets used in the Repository: 1. Dataset on Alcohol Consumption (From fivethirtyeight.com)
                                 2. Dataset on Diamonds (From RÂ´s in-built database)
                                 
The file that should be open is the one with data on Alcohol Consumption, given that it has the source to the one with the diamonds data. 
We performed basic descriptive statistics using the datasets and made some histogram plots.
We have also performed a pull request via Github with another team (Rafael and Rita).
